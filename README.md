<h2 align="left"> Purpose of research:  </h2>
<p align="left">
The selected theme was "Procedural animation in 2D electronic games and their applications" 
</p>

<br/>
<h2 align="left"> What is a Procedural Animation: </h3>
<p align="left">
Procedural animation is the production process for real-time animations based on algorithms.

For the procedural generation of character animation, you need
some algorithms and attachments provided by the Unity tool, which are
corresponding Inverse Kinematics algorithms

IK is the algorithm that calculates the positioning and rotation of a set of
members to reach a desired destination. For its operation, it is necessary
that all sprites (2D graphic elements inserted into the game) that apply an IK,
have its limbs interconnected by bones.
