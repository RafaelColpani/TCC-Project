<h2 align="left"> Purpose of research:  </h2>
<p align="left">
The chosen theme is "Procedural animation in 2D electronic games and their applications" 
</p>

<br/>
<h2 align="left"> What is Procedural Animation: </h3>
<p align="left">
Procedural Animation is the production process for real-time animations based on algorithms.

For the procedural generation of character animations, 
some algorithms and attachments provided by the Unity engine. 
They match the algorithms of Inverse Kinematics.

IK is the algorithm that calculates the position and rotation of a set of 
limbs in order to reach a desired destination. For it to work, it is necessary
That every sprite (2D graphic elements that are inserted in the game) that apply an IK 
have their limbs connected through bones.
